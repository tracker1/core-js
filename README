NOTE: Most of this stuff is *REALLY* old now, and you probably want to use 
more modern modules from npm.

Some javascript object model extensions, as well as browser extensions that 
I find pretty essential.

js-extensions are extensions to javascript directly, they should be usable both 
client-side and server-side.

browser-extensions are scripts that are to be used inside of a web browser.
